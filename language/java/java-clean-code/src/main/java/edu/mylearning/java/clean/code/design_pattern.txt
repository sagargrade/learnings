Certainly! Here is a list of common design patterns in Java, categorized into three main types: Creational, Structural, and Behavioral patterns.

Creational Patterns
Singleton: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
Factory Method: Defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created.
Abstract Factory: Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
Builder: Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.
Prototype: Specifies the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new objects by copying this prototype.

Structural Patterns
Adapter: Allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together.
Bridge: Decouples an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.
Composite: Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
Decorator: Adds additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.
Facade: Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.
Flyweight: Uses sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently.
Proxy: Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.
Behavioral Patterns
Chain of Responsibility: Passes a request along a chain of handlers. Upon receiving a request, each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it to the next handler in the chain.
Command: Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations.
Interpreter: Defines a representation for a language's grammar and uses that representation to interpret sentences in the language.
Iterator: Provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
Mediator: Defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. Mediator promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly.
Memento: Captures and externalizes an object's internal state without violating encapsulation, so that the object can be restored to this state later.
Observer: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
State: Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.
Strategy: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
Template Method: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses. Template Method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.
Visitor: Represents an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure. Visitor lets you define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates.
These design patterns provide proven solutions to common software design problems, making it easier to design flexible and reusable object-oriented software.
